	<h1>Introduction to PHP</h1>
		PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people
		found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back
		in 1994. The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. 
	<ul>
		<li>PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to
			manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire ecommerce sites. </li>
		<li> It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL,
			Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. </li>
		<li>PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache
			module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very
			complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time. </li>
		<li> PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP.
			PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time. </li>
		<li>PHP Syntax is C-Like</li>
	</ul>

	

	<p>Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."

	What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.</p>

	<h1> Superglobals of PHP </h1>
		<p>Superglobals â€” Superglobals are built-in variables that are always available in all scopes</p>
		<table>
			<th> Variable</th>
			<th> Description </th>
		<tr>
			<td>$GLOBALS</td>
			<td>Contains a reference to every variable which is currently available within the global scope of the script. The keys of this array are the
				names of the global variables.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_SERVER</td>
			<td>This is an array containing information such as headers, paths, and script locations. The entries in this array are created by the web
			server. There is no guarantee that every web server will provide any of these. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_GET</td>
			<td>An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP GET method.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_POST</td>
			<td>An associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_FILES</td>
			<td>An associative array of items uploaded to the current script via the HTTP POST method.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_REQUEST</td>
			<td>An associative array consisting of the contents of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_COOKIE </td>
			<td>An associative array of variables passed to the current script via HTTP cookies.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_SESSION </td>
			<td>An associative array containing session variables available to the current script.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$_PHP_SELF </td>
			<td>A string containing PHP script file name in which it is called.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$php_errormsg</td>
			<td>$php_crrormsg is a variable containing the text of the last error message generated by PHP.</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
	<h1> Starting a PHP Session</h1>
		
		<p>A PHP session is easily started by making a call to the session_start() function. This
		function first checks if a session is already started and if none is started, then it starts one. It is recommended to put the call to <b>session_start()</b> at the beginning of the page.
		<b>Session variables</b> are stored in associative array called <b>$_SESSION[].</b> These variables can be accessed during lifetime of a session.
			The following example starts a session and then registers a variable called counter that is incremented each time the page is visited during the session.
			Make use of<b> isset()</b> function to check if session variable is already set or not.
		</p>
		<p>It will produce the following line:</p>
		
	<h1>PHP opening and closing Tags syntax</h1>
			<p><Strong>4</Strong> different pairs of opening and closing tag for PHP</p>
              <ol>
				<li>Default syntax</li>
				<p>he default syntax starts with <strong>"&lt?" php" and ends with "?/&gt".</strong></p>
				<li>Short open Tags</li>
				<p>The short tags starts with <strong> &lt?" and ends with "?&gt</strong></p>
				<li>HTML Script Tags</li>
				<li>ASP Style Tags</li>
				<p>The ASP style tags starts with "<strong>&lt%" and ends with "&gt</strong>"</p>
			</ol>
				<strong><p>Rules for statement separation</p></strong>
			<ol>
				<li>a semicolon</li>
				<li>AND/OR</li>
				<li>a closing PHP tag</li>
			</ol>
		<h1>Destroying a PHP Session </h1>
		<img src="images/php4.png" alt="my-image"/>
		<p>The Session_destroy() function in PHP destroys all the data associated with the current session. However, it does not unset any of the global variables associated with the session nor does it unset the session cookie. It is often used in conjunction with session_unset() to more thoroughly remove the session.</p>
